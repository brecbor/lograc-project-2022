# Definitional interpreters for STLC - sum and algebraic data types 

*Project for the Logic in computer science course*

## Task

Task of the project was to implement STCL and extend it with sum types and algebraic data types (W types). For each of the types we defined typing rules for contructors and desctructors as well as interpretation of those functions. Some examples are included to ilustrate the application of the language.


## Files structure

`project/`: folder contains agda code for the project which is defined in the following files:
- Interpreter.agda: contains interpretation of the language
- STLC.agda: contains typing rules for the language
- OurTest.agda: contains few test examples
- Signature.agda: signature of the language
